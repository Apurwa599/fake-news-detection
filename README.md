# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning and NLP
## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system classifies news articles as fake or real to reduce the impact of misinformation.

## Problem Statement
Fake news spreads rapidly through online platforms and social media. It can mislead people and create biased opinions. This project aims to
identify fake news automatically using ML algorithms.

## Dataset Description
This project uses a Fake News Dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
The dataset contains news articles with labels indicating whether the news is fake or real. 
It is suitable for text classification using NLP techniques.
